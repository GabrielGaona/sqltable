List of extensions
==================


For contributors
================

When adding or updating your extension, please adhere to these guidelines:

* Each extension must be either a submodule or subpackage of the
  ``sphinxcontrib`` package.
* Each extension must be listed in this file under "List of extensions" above,
  and in ``setup.py``'s ``long_desc`` string.
* Each author should be listed in ``AUTHORS`` along with the extension name.
* It would be good to have all extensions BSD licensed; otherwise make a note in
  the ``LICENSE`` file.
* Each extension can maintain a changelog; this file should be called
  ``CHANGES.extensionname``.
